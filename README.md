# shortest-path-finder
This program is used to find a shortest path from a vertex to any destination vertex in weighted-directed graph.

# Description
Using the path to the input file specified as the command line argument, this program takes a single csv file with start vertices, destination vertices, and their corresponding weights. The program then constructs a weighted-directed graph and calculates the shortest path from a start vertex to a destination vertex using Dijkstra's algorithm.
